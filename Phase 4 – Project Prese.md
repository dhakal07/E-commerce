## üéØ Project Title

**E-Commerce Platform with Admin Dashboard**

---

## üìù Project Overview

This e-commerce platform is designed for online shoppers and administrators, providing a seamless shopping experience and robust management tools. Regular users can register, log in, add items to their cart, place orders, submit feedback, and request returns. Administrators access a dedicated dashboard to monitor user activity, manage returns, track orders, and review feedback. The platform aims to balance user convenience with administrative oversight, serving as a practical showcase of full-stack development skills.

The project targets e-commerce enthusiasts, small business owners, and developers learning full-stack technologies, built to simulate a real-world online store with secure authentication and data management.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Technical Implementation

The e-commerce platform leverages a robust tech stack and thoughtful architecture:

- **Frontend**: React.js with React Router for navigation and Context API (e.g., `AuthContext`, `CartContext`) for state management. Styled with CSS, featuring an orange theme (`#ff8c69`) to match the navbar.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for a RESTful API, handling authentication, orders, feedback, and admin data.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Docker containerization (`ecommerce-db`) for persistent storage of `users`, `orders`, `feedback`, `returns`, and `logins`.
- **Authentication**: JWT with `bcrypt` for secure password hashing and role-based access (admin role for dashboard).
- **Tools**: Postman for API testing, Git for version control.

### Key Features & Implementation Details
- **Secure User Authentication**:
  ```javascript
  app.post('/api/users/register', (req, res) => {
    const { email, password } = req.body;
    bcrypt.hash(password, 10, (err, hashedPassword) => {
      if (err) return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error encrypting password' });
      client.query('INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES ($1, $2)', [email, hashedPassword], (err) => {
        if (err) return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error registering user' });
        res.status(201).json({ message: 'User registered successfully!' });
      });
    });
  });
- **Order Management:**:
  ```javascript
  app.post('/api/orders', (req, res) => {
  const { useremail, total, status } = req.body;
  client.query('INSERT INTO orders (useremail, total, status, createdat) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, NOW())', [useremail, total, status], (err) => {
    if (err) return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error adding order' });
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Order placed successfully!' });
  });
});
- **Admin Dashboard Data**:
  ```javascript
  const getAllReturns = async (req, res) => {
  const result = await client.query(`
    SELECT r.id, r.orderid AS order_id, o.useremail AS email, r.productname, r.reason, r.status, r.createdat AS return_date 
    FROM returns r LEFT JOIN orders o ON r.orderid = o.id
  `);
  res.status(200).json(result.rows);
};  
## Development Process

Over approximately 135 hours, the project evolved through these phases:

**Phase 1 (Planning):**  
Defined use cases and designed the PostgreSQL schema, sketching UI wireframes.

**Phase 2 (Backend Setup):**  
Built the Node.js/Express backend, integrated PostgreSQL with Docker, and implemented JWT authentication. Challenges included CORS setup and database connectivity.

**Phase 3 (Frontend Development):**  
Developed the React frontend (navbar, cart, user pages), overcoming initial state management issues with Context API. Styled iteratively to align with the orange theme.

**Phase 4 (Admin Features):**  
Added the admin dashboard, resolving schema mismatches (e.g., useremail vs. email) with updated queries.

**Phase 5 (Testing & Polishing):**  
Tested all features, fixed bugs (e.g., order.total.toFixed with parseFloat), and aligned dashboard styling.
## ‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and Future Work

### What Worked Well
- **Full-Stack Success:** Integrated React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL into a functional e-commerce system.  
- **Admin Dashboard:** Became a robust monitoring tool with iterative enhancements.  
- **Learning Curve:** Mastered JWT, Context API, and database joins, enhancing my skill set.

### Challenges Faced
- **Schema Mismatches:** Incorrect column names (e.g., useremail) required extensive debugging.  
- **Data Type Issues:** Resolved `order.total.toFixed` errors by parsing strings.  
- **Cart Total Calculation:** Encountered `$NaN` due to invalid quantity parsing, requiring debugging of state management and number conversion.  
- **Time Constraints:** Limited time led to deferring features like user deletion.

### Future Improvements
- **New Features:** Add user account deletion and admin user banning.  
- **UI Enhancements:** Implement direct category navigation links between Male, Female, and Kids Clothing pages with active link styling (bold), enhancing user experience. Further improvements could include pagination and mobile optimization.  
- **Cart Functionality:** Resolve cart total calculation issues with robust quantity and price parsing.  
- **Performance:** Add indexes and caching for larger datasets.  
- **Testing:** Introduce Jest and Mocha for automated testing.
